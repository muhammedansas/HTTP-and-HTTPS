# HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) :-
    
    # Definition: 
        # HTTP is an application-layer protocol used for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML, across the internet. 
        # It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and how web servers and browsers should respond to various commands. 
        # HTTP is stateless, meaning each request from a client to the server is independent, and the server does not retain any session information between requests.
    # Purpose :
        # HTTP is the foundational protocol used by the World Wide Web to load web pages and transfer data.
    # How it works :
        # When you type a URL into your browser, HTTP is the protocol that enables your browser to request a web page from a server. 
        # The server then responds with the requested web page, which is displayed by your browser.
    # Security :
        # HTTP does not encrypt the data that is transmitted between the browser and the server. 
        # This means that any information sent over an HTTP connection can potentially be intercepted and read by third parties (like hackers).




# HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) :-

    # Definition: 
        # HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, using SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) to encrypt the data exchanged between a client and server. 
        # This encryption ensures that the data remains confidential and integral during transmission, protecting it from eavesdropping, tampering, and man-in-the-middle attacks. 
        # HTTPS also authenticates the identity of the server through certificates, providing an additional layer of security.
    # Purpose :
        # HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP. It is used to securely transmit data over the internet.
    # How it works :
        # HTTPS uses encryption protocols such as SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) to encrypt the data transmitted between the browser and the server. 
        # This ensures that any data exchanged is private and cannot be easily intercepted or tampered with. 
    # Security :
        # HTTPS is essential for protecting sensitive information, such as credit card details, passwords, and personal data, making it the standard for secure communication on the web.

# Statelessness vs Security 
# ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    # Statelessness:
        # In HTTP, each request is independent, and the server doesn't retain any session information unless specifically implemented through cookies, sessions, or tokens. 
        # This means that HTTP by itself doesn't track user interactions over time. 
        # While this can limit certain types of attacks (like session hijacking), it doesn't address the security of the data being transmitted.
    # Lack of Encryption :
    #     The main security issue with HTTP is that the data transmitted between the client and the server is sent in plain text. 
    #     This means that anyone who intercepts the data (via a man-in-the-middle attack, for instance) can read or modify it. 
    #     For example, if you log in to a website using HTTP, your username and password can potentially be seen by anyone monitoring the network.





# Why HTTPS is Secure :-

    # Encryption :
    #     HTTPS encrypts the data sent between the client and the server using SSL/TLS. 
    #     Even though HTTPS is also stateless like HTTP, the data transmitted is encrypted, making it unreadable to anyone who might intercept it.

    # Integrity :
    #     HTTPS ensures that the data received by the client or server hasn't been tampered with during transmission.

    # Authentication :
    #     HTTPS uses certificates to authenticate the server, helping ensure that the client is communicating with the legitimate server and not an imposter.



# SUMMARY :
    # - HTTP's statelessness doesn't inherently make it secure; it simply means that each request is independent.
    # - HTTP lacks encryption, making it vulnerable to interception and eavesdropping, which compromises the confidentiality and integrity of the data.
    # - HTTPS addresses these security concerns by encrypting the data and ensuring its integrity and authenticity, providing a secure channel even though it remains stateless like HTTP.
